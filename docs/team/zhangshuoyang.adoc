== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
AddressBook - Level 4 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/zhangshuoyang.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/zhangshuoyang.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Add Tasks

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addtask]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The `addtask` feature allows users to manage their tasks within the address book application, instead of switching
between different apps. It offers a place for the to-do list to be stored, managed and organised. This feature will
not do your tasks for you, but it is powerful enough to get you started.

Once the task is successfully added, it will be displayed on the sticky note in the task panel, as shown below:

=== Enhancement Added: Theme Selection

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=themeselect]

#End of Extract#

---
==== Justification

The `select theme` feature allows users to choose their favourite theme from the default set of themes available.
It allows users to have a more personalised address book.

After a theme is selected, the user interface will be updated immediately. For instance, after switching to Light Theme,
the following result will be displayed.
